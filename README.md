## Healthy Food Ordering

Show an alert in the cart when adding items which are not meeting with the user's predefined health conditions (later it can be connected to the health apps for example iPhone health app).

This will require being able to enter their preferences etc. in the application; as well as storing or deriving the relevant data for menu items.

This idea can be combined with encouraging users to do self pick-up of their orders from the restaurants by presenting the user with how many calories they would burn if they were to walk to/from the restaurant using geo-data.

This will also achieve other sustainability goals such as

1. Carbon neutrality: Reduce carbon footprint for our lovely earth.
2. Sustainability: Positive PR exposure, partnership opportunities, and environment budget from gov
3. SG government Environmental Initiatives: 3P Partnership Fund/ Call for Ideas Fund (CIF)
4. A European Green Deal
5. Meets customer's inner drive e.g., happiness, healthiness.
6. Increase GP. Eliminate DF cost to customer & pay to rider
7. Increase order growth esp. pickup order
